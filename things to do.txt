 Portfolio Analysis & Improvement Recommendations

  Your portfolio shows strong technical implementation with modern
  practices. Here are key improvements to land your first remote
  frontend role:

  Critical Issues to Fix

  1. SEO & Discoverability
  - Missing meta description, Open Graph tags, and structured data
  - Title is generic - should be "Weyehn Reeves | Frontend
  Developer | UMass CS Graduate"
  - Add canonical URL and proper favicon

  2. Performance Optimization
  - Large CSS file (22KB) should be split into
  critical/non-critical parts
  - Missing image optimization (WebP format, lazy loading)
  - No bundle compression or caching headers

  3. Missing Resume Download
  - "Download Resume" button has no functionality - critical for
  job applications
  - Add actual PDF resume file and wire up the button

  Technical Improvements

  4. Code Organization
  portfolio.js:1-50 - Remove 13 console.log statements before
  production
  css/main.css:1407-1455 - Add more responsive breakpoints
  (mobile-first approach)

  5. Accessibility Issues
  - Missing skip navigation link
  - Some interactive elements need better keyboard navigation
  - Color contrast ratios should be verified

  6. Modern Development Practices
  - Add TypeScript for better code quality
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Add unit tests for key functionality

  Content & Presentation

  7. Professional Polish
  - Add more specific project descriptions with tech stacks
  - Include live demo links and GitHub repos for projects
  - Add testimonials or recommendations if available

  8. Industry-Specific Features
  - Add a blog section showcasing technical knowledge
  - Include code samples or GitHub contributions
  - Add certifications or continued learning section

  Deployment & Production

  - Set up proper CI/CD pipeline
  - Add environment-based configurations
  - Implement proper error logging and monitoring

  Priority Order: Fix resume download → SEO optimization →
  performance → accessibility → modern practices

  Your component-based architecture and responsive design are
  excellent foundations. Focus on the critical issues first to make
   your portfolio production-ready for job applications.

Next SEO priorities:

  1. Structured Data (JSON-LD) - Tell Google "this is a developer's
   portfolio" in a way it really understands
  2. Semantic HTML - Make sure you're using proper HTML tags like
  <main>, <article>, <section>
  3. Canonical URL - Tell search engines the official URL of your
  site
  4. Image Alt Tags - Make sure all images have descriptions for
  accessibility and SEO
  5. Sitemap - A roadmap of your site for search engines

  Which would you like to tackle first?

  I'd recommend Structured Data next - it's like giving Google your
   "developer resume" in a format it loves, which can help you show
   up in job-related searches.

 You can test this:
  1. Go to Google's https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
  2. Enter your portfolio URL when it's live
  3. See how Google reads your structured data
